	<br>All inquiries regarding tuition and other fees may be directed to the Accounting Office.
	<br>			
	<br><b>	Payment Schemes</b>
	<br><b>Students have the option to choose from two payment schemes:</b>	
	<br>	•	Full Payment
	<br>		•	Installment scheme (with installment interest charge of 10% for 10months or 1% per month), initial payment required = P5,000.00
	<br>			   
	<br><b>		If the student has opted to pay by installment and:</b>
	<br>			•	 His check payment bounces, the full amount becomes immediately due and demandable and must be paid in cash. Also, future check payments will no longer be accepted.
	<br><br>				He fails to pay on due dates, a 1% penalty for late payment will be charged for every month of delay.
			
	<br><br>				Upon enrolment, the student and/or his parent(s)/guardian(s) bind themselves to pay corresponding tuition and other school fees. In case of failure to pay off the due and demandable tuition and other school fees as scheduled, 
	<br>		or until the closing of the semester/Quarter, it is understood that the students and parent(s)/guardian(s) recognized, without reservation, the night/authority of the school to:
	<br>			•	Suspend the students from taking periodical exams;
	<br>			•	Withhold the records of the students; or
	<br>			•	Pay the penalty clause, if any, without need of judicial intervention or permission.
	<br>		
	<br><b>			Mode of Payments</b>
	<br>					Payment may be made only in cash or personal check.
	<br><br>			•	It is presumed that the personal check payments are backed with sufficient funds. If a check bounces, it must be replaced immediately with cash plus Php 1,000.00 penalty. Future check payments will no longer be accepted.
	<br>		   Students are considered enrolled only after payment of the required fees
	<br>	   
	<br><b>		3. Reimbursement. </b>
	<br>			  If student has paid the pertinent tuition and other fees in full or installment but voluntary and in writing withdraws from school,
	<br>		 transfers to another school, or drop in the beginning of classes, he shall be entitled to a refund of tuition and/or other fees based on the following schedule:
	<br>		
	<br><b>			For Regular Semester/Quarters:</b>
	<table cellspacing="20">
	<tr>
				
				<td>
				<font size = "1" face = "Verdana" color="green">
						Within the first week of classes
					<br>Within the second week   
					<br>After the second week      
					<th><th><th><th><th>	<th><th><th><th><th>		 
											  
				<td>
				<font size = "1" face = "Verdana" color="green">
						75% Refund
					<br>50% Refund
					<br>No Refund
	</tr>
	</table>
	
	
	<br>		This schedule shall be followed whether or not the student attended classes. Refund will be processed only after the student has obtained the necessary clearance.
	<br>	
	<br>		Refunds due to overpayment, or overpayment resulting from a change in the student’s academic load, are credited toward subsequent enrolments.
	<br>	 However may be reimbursed upon submission of a letter from the student’s parent(s)/guardian(s).
	<br>	
	<br><b>		4. Arrears </b>
	<br>	   If the student has unsettled accounts or arrears from the previous semester/year, he may enroll for the following semester only after these accounts or arrears plus the corresponding finance charges have been settled.
